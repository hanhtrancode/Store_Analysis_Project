I have been engaged by a multinational vehicle distribution company operating across 20+ countries to enhance their stock management, optimize marketing communication, and support new customer acquisition. My objective is to provide actionable, data-driven insights to help the company make informed decisions.

To meet these goals, Iâ€™ll address critical questions, including:

* Which products should be prioritized for reorder or reduced inventory?
* How can marketing and communication strategies be tailored to align with customer behavior patterns?
* What are the geographic locations of our customer base?
* What budget allocation is optimal for effective customer acquisition?
* By answering these questions, I aim to equip the company with strategic tools to drive efficiency and growth.
